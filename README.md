## Description 💁

Budget Town was designed to give users a fast and easy way to track their money. Even if said user needs to be offline for a while. The user can add expenses and deposits to their budget without an internet connection, and the app will be updated when they get back online.

I learned a lot about progressive web applications through the completion of this project. Specifically, I learned how to use IndexedDB and service workers to allow use of offline features.
